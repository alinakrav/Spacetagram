# ShopifyChallenge

Go to https://alinakrav.github.io/ShopifyChallenge to see it in action :)

### Details you may have missed
* If you search for a movie, nominate it, then search for something else and come back to it, the Nominate function is still disabled because that would be a duplicate (this is easy to overlook but I caught it and ensured it works perfectly)

* The API doesn't return anything when there are too many results, so searches should be more or less specific

* Search results are updated as the user is typing
